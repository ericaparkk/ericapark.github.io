    <h3>Chosen emotion: Shame</h3>
</div>

<div class = "section">
    <h3>Script</h3>
1. Start with drawing out one eye with a black pen near the top right corner of the white canvas. </br>
2. A baby blue teardrop will come out from the right corner of this eye. </br>
3. Two hands with black outline and white filling will emerge from the bottom of the picture, imitating covering a face. </br>
4. The hand on OUR right side covers ⅓ part of the eye. </br>
5. Apply a lot of short dark blue pen strokes around the frame of the canvas, achieving the look of a birdnest – these pen strokes cover the bottom of the emerging hands but they don’t cover the eye and the upper half of these hands.
